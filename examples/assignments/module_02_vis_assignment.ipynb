    "# Visualization Assignment Part I: \n",
    "\n",
    "We have now seen some of the fundamentals of `Matplotlib`. In this assignment, we will put those things to use by visualizing the `wine dataset` from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine. I will provide two functions to handle loading the data, `load_data`, and `wine_description`. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### An Assignment in Three Parts\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three parts to this assignment: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. visualize the distribution of one or more features in the dataset; \n",
    "2. visualize the relationship between two or more features in the dataset; \n",
    "3. choose your own method of visualizing some aspect of this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the three visualizations, write a figure caption in the `markdown` cell below your figure. Visualization is not only about the figures that we create, a proper figure description is important to clearly communicate the intent of the visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note:\n",
    "You are not limited to using `Matplotlib` for your visualizations! If there is another library that you prefer to use, please feel free to do so. The key is that your visualizations are communicative, not the method that you use."
